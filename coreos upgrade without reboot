Feature Request
1. CoreOS version upgrade without node reboot.

2. As of today, we need to reboot the nodes once CoreOS version upgrade is done. 
We should be able to upgrade the CoreOS version without doing reboots

Environment
N/A

What hardware/cloud provider/hypervisor is being used to run CoreOS?
Dell/Radisys/HP

Desired Feature
1. Installing the CoreOS upgrades to new paritiona and switch the paritions without reboot.

Currently CoreOS version upgrade happens in the passive parition and after reboot, passive parition 
becomes active and vice-versa. If we can acheive this without doing reboot it will grealty help us in 
reducing the downtime as well as save from frequent reboots.
